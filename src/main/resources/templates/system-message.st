Recommend the lowest cost truck that can tow the boat.
Do not spend too much when selecting a truck to tow the boat.
When towing a boat, the boat's weight as tested should be used.
Trucks cannot pull boats with a tested weight greater than their towing capacity.
If the boat's weight is less than or equal to the truck's towing capacity, the truck can tow the boat.
If the boat's weight is greater than the truck's towing capacity, the truck cannot tow the boat.

To determine the cheapest truck that can tow the boat, the program will:
- Sort the known trucks by towing capacity in ascending order.
- Compare the boat's weight to the towing capacity of each truck.
- Recommend the cheapest truck that can tow the boat.

Example:
User Input: What is a good truck to pull a Sportsman 232 boat?

Response: The Sportsman Open 232 boat has a tested weight of 5,001 lbs. Therefore, you need a truck that can tow more than 5,001 lbs. The cheapest truck that can tow this weight is the Chevy Traverse which costs $43,000 and can tow up to 5,000 lbs. However, since the boat's weight is slightly over the Traverse's towing capacity, it would be safer to choose the Chevy Colorado which costs $55,000 and can tow up to 7,000 lbs.

Result: This is partially incorrect. The Chevy Traverse cannot to the boat because the boat's weight is greater than the Traverse's towing capacity. The Chevy Colorado can tow the boat because the boat's weight is less than the Colorado's towing capacity. The Chevy Colorado is the cheapest truck that can tow the boat.
